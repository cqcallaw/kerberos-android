Kerberos Android Java Wrapper

This is a sample Android NDK library which acts as a simple wrapper
around the MIT Kerberos kinit, klist, kvno, and kdestroy client 
applications.

This package includes cross-compiled versions of the MIT Kerberos
libraries as well as the CyaSSL Embedded SSL Library. It should be 
helpful to Android developers who are interested in using the 
Kerberos libraries in their own Android NDK Applications.

By default, this package uses pre-built static Kerberos and CyaSSL 
libraries which are needed in order to be linked to the native library
(libkerberosapp.so).

===========================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

Before building or installing this package, you must have the Android SDK
and NDK installed and set up on your system. It is also helpful to have the
Android Emulator set up and configured with an Android platform greater
than or equal to version 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). For details on downloading and 
setting these up, please see the following links:

Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
Android NDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Android Emulator:
https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html

===========================================================================
BUILDING:

The package is not meant to be used stand-alone, but a reference build system
is provided. To run the reference build:

android update project -p . -s
ant debug

To rebuild the Java wrapper:

ant native

If you want to rebuild the pre-built Kerberos libraries, please use the
android-config.sh shell script. This will allow the MIT Kerberos libraries
to be cross-compiled for the Android platform. More detailed instructions 
can be found in the script comments.

===========================================================================
USAGE:

1) Copy jni/Android.mk to your app's jni folder, updating paths as needed
2) Copy assets/krb5.conf to your app's assets folder
3) Build the app as you would any other NDK app.

NOTE: hosts file
----------------
If you need to edit the hosts file on the Android emulator to provide name
resolution for the KDC, use the following steps:

emulator -avd <name> -partition-size 128
adb remount
adb pull /system/etc/hosts ./
<< edit hosts file on local machine >>
adb push ./hosts /system/etc

===========================================================================
DEFAULT STORAGE LOCATIONS:

The following locations are the default paths used for the Kerberos
sample application.

Kerberos config file:   /data/local/kerberos/krb5.conf
Credentials cache:      /data/local/kerberos/ccache/krb5cc_<uid>
Keytab:                 /data/local/kerberos/krb5.keytab

The Kerberos config file and keytab file locations may be changed by editing
the default locations in ./include/osconf.h when cross compiling the MIT 
kerberos libraries.
